 and courses. As distance learning becomes a serious alternative to the

            <center> <h1><b> INTRODUCTION</b></h1></center>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology-based distance education is emerging as an increasingly
 visible feature of post-secondary education in the United States (U.S. Depart
ment of Education, 1999). Technology is changing the way the university
 functions as an institution of higher learning. Publications such as The
 Chronicle of Higher Education regularly feature articles about the distance
 education efforts of various higher education institutions and systems, states,
 and consortia. Distance education specialists and academic policymakers
 expect technology to help higher education institutions provide a wide range
 of programs, including degree programs, to larger proportions of the student
 population (U.S. Department of Education, 1997).
 In distance education, or distance learning, the students and instructors
 emain geographically apart. Today, the ability to take courses from a remote
 location utilizing the Internet is referred to as “e-learning” (Quan, 2000); e
learning is the dot-com term for distance education. Concepts of lifelong
 learning, individualized or personalized learning, and time-free, space-free,
 “just-in-time” learning arrangements have emerged, all of which allow
 learning away from the traditional campus (American Council on Education,
 1996). Distance education is a key strategy in meeting the massive demand for
 higher education.
 Distance education is first and foremost a movement that sought not so
 much to challenge or change the structure of higher learning, but to extend the
 traditional university in order to overcome its inherent problems of scarcity
 and exclusivity. Second, distance education developed as a creative political
 response to the increasing inability of the traditional university structure to
 grow bigger (Hall, J., 1995). Distance education dealt with the problem of too
 many students in a single physical space.
 The increasing diversity in demand for education means the virtual
 campus is a model for the future. Developed societies are moving further from
 the traditional model, where people complete their education at an early age
 and then dedicate themselves solely to work (Warden, 1995). Simple desktop
 computers can now function on the Internet as powerful, multimedia, inter
active communication centers. New Internet tools, such as bulletin boards,
 electronic tests, hyper-linked texts and sources, and enhanced computer
 systems with greater speed and more memory, allow viewers to see more
 information and tune in on discussions, meetings, theatrical performances,
 even operas, around the world (Gallick, 1998). Such features offer rich
 opportunities for distance education.
 Distance learning is emerging as part of mainstream education (Ameri
can Council on Education, 1996). So, “What is distance education and  what is its use in the United States?” To answer this question, we examine
 the media used in distance education, the type of student utilizing distance
 education, advantages and disadvantages in the use of distance education,
 and the players involved.
</p>
        <center><h1 style="padding-top: 20px"><b> MEDIA USED IN DISTANCE EDUCATION</b></h1></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distance education employs media in many forms and to varying
 degrees. It uses mail, facsimile, radio, television, satellite broadcasts, video
tapes, teleconferencing, electronic mail, chatrooms, bulletin boards, CD
ROM, the Internet, and the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The “first generation” of distance education technologies included print,
 radio and television. The “second generation” added audiocassettes, video
tapes, and fax. Both generations of technology were primarily one-way
 (asynchronous) communication from the faculty to the student.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      The “first generation” of distance education technologies included print,
 radio and television. The “second generation” added audiocassettes, video
tapes, and fax. Both generations of technology were primarily one-way
 (asynchronous) communication from the faculty to the student.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In 1985 and for the next ten years, CD-ROM technology was developed
 and used to deliver instruction. We also witnessed two-way interactive
 capabilities (synchronous or simultaneous, real-time communication) utiliz
ing computers and computer networks, including the Internet and the World
 Wide Web. Audioconferencing and videoconferencing came into being.
 High-quality interactive videoconferencing provides additional enhance
ments to distance teaching. In videoconferencing, a faculty member teaches
 a class in a traditional classroom setting while concurrently instructing a
 different group of students in another classroom via interactive video.
 Introducing an audio link from the remote site back to the lecturer allows live
 interaction and enables questions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The use of the “virtual classroom” is a growing development in distance
 learning. It is usually based on computer groupware, but can be operated over
 the Internet. Both groupware—or “courseware”—and the Internet utilize
 synchronous and asynchronous instruction. In general, the student uses a local
 computer (usually from home) to access a range of services and facilities.
 These include online registration, dissemination of prepared course materials
 (such as the course syllabus, assignments, and practice tests), access to online
 video materials, and communication with instructors, tutors, and other
 students via electronic mail (email). Frequently, courses have their own Web
 page where instructors post their syllabi and assignments, as well as links to
 other informative Web sites, periodicals, and shared audio and video files.
 “Classes” and discussion groups are conducted in online chatrooms; assign
ments and exams are emailed to the instructor. Discussion topics are posted
 to discussion or bulletin boards (“threaded discussions”); students comment
 on the selected topics, and they may also post new topics<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The Web is used in teaching in two different ways. A Web-Assisted
 Course (WAC) has a traditional classroom setting and uses the Web to
 exchange email for communication between students and instructors in
 chatrooms and to download course materials and obtain grades. A Web
Based Course (WBC) is a stand-alone course delivered to students who do not
 meet in a traditional classroom; these students take the course from a remote
 location via the Web.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The United States Department of Education (1999) conducted a survey
 on distance education and found the following regarding the then current use
 and the planned use of technology
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 30px"> Distance education courses were delivered by asynchronous Internet
 instruction at 58% of post-secondary institutions, by two-way inter
active video at 54%, and by one-way prerecorded video at 47% of the
 institutions in the 1997-1998 academic year. Nineteen percent of the
 institutions offered courses using synchronous Internet instruction.
 Thus, more institutions used several types of video technologies and
 the Internet-based technologies than other modes of delivery. (p. 38)
 Institutions planned to start using, or to increase their use of
 asynchronous Internet instruction as a primary mode of delivery
 more than any other type of technology, with 82% of the institutions
 planning to start or increase their use of this technology. Two-way
 interactive video (cited by 61%) and synchronous Internet instruc
tion (cited by 60%) were also indicated as technologies planned for
 an increasing role in delivering distance education in the next three
 years. (p. 39)</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The methods by which higher education institutions provide instruction
 are changing rapidly. The integration of computers into teaching as we are
 now experiencing may be one of the most significant contributions to
 education ever known (Buikema & Ward, 1999). Now faculty have a growing
 range of distance education tools allowing them to bring information re
sources, simulation capabilities, and other enhancements to instruction.</p>

 range of distance education tools allowing them to bring information re
sources, simulation capabilities, and other enhancements to instruction.</p>
        <center><h1 style="padding-top: 20px"><b> TYPE OF STUDENT</b></h1></center>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education has a long history of serving isolated and remote
 learners (American Council on Education, 1996). Today, in addition to
 serving the learner who lives far from campus, distance education is aimed at
 part-time students, time-strapped adult learners, and students trying to work
 full time while earning degrees. Virtual classrooms are not aimed at the
 traditional market of young college people, but rather are meant to serve

 disciplined adult learners (Guernsey, 1998). Students are typically older than
 traditional undergraduates (On Line, 1998, May 22). Interestingly, the typical
 distance learning student is a 43 year old woman, with a $73,000 household
 income, who is looking for a career change or career enhancement (Lucas,
 1998, as cited in Buikema & Ward, 1999). The age profile of students,
 whether men or women, suggests that many will have family commitments.
 It is unlikely that they would be willing or able to leave home to attend a full
time, campus-based course (Miller, Smith & Tilstone, 1998). Distance
 learning primarily attracts women with children. Sixty-six percent of the adult
 distance education market is female, and 80% of them have children (Bremner,
 1998). As a rule, the distance learner is serious, disciplined, conscientious,
 and demanding (O’Leary, 2000). According to professors who teach online
 courses, virtual classes require unflagging self-discipline, self-motivation,
 and efficient time management by the student.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education (1997) in
 1995, more higher education institutions offered distance education courses
 designed primarily for undergraduate students (81% of the institutions) and
 graduate students (34% of the institutions) than for any other type of student.
 Professionals seeking recertification were targeted by 39% of institutions
 offering distance education courses, and other workers seeking skill updating
 or retraining were targeted by 49%.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In the fall of 1998, another student population emerged—students
 already enrolled in regular classes eager to ease their schedules by taking
 courses online. Many colleges and universities find students enrolled in
 distance education courses simultaneously enrolled in on-campus courses
 (“The Costs of Teaching,” 2000). Many of these students work part-time
 or full-time jobs and they need the freedom to manage their time (Guern
sey, 1998)
        </p>

<center><h1 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF<br>
    OFFERING DISTANCE EDUCATION</b></h1></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are benefits and drawbacks to offering distance education. Advan
tages accrue to both the student and to the institution; however, there are
 numerous disadvantages that must be considered</p>

<h2><b>Benefits to the Student</b></h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benefits to the student include: increased access to higher education
 (particularly for the nontraditional student), flexible scheduling of personal

 time, convenient location (students can attend class from any corner of the
 globe), individualized attention by the instructor, less travel, and increased
 time to think about and respond to (via email or discussion boards) questions
 posed by the instructor (Matthews, 1999). Shy students can anonymously
 speak up in chatrooms. Often students who participate in online courses say
 they get to know one another better than in a traditional class (Buikema &
 Ward, 1999); chatrooms build a sense of community. Increased access to
 certificate and degree programs can have the further benefit of encouraging
 students to undertake these programs or to complete them more quickly
 (Turoff, 1997, as cited in U.S. Department of Education, 1999).</p>
        <h2><b>   Benefits to the Institution Offering Distance Education</b></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The institution also reaps benefits from offering distance education. It
 increases enrollment, attracts more qualified students, increases retention and
 graduation rates, and increases institutional prestige (Buikema & Ward,
 1999). In addition, offering distance education attracts new teaching staff
 (those interested in distance education), allows instructors freedom to be
 more creative in the classroom, reduces the need to build and maintain
 university campuses and buildings, offers a new level of communication with
 students, requires the university to keep abreast of new technology, and
 signals the public that the institution is forward thinking and technologically
      advanced (Matthews, 1999)</p>
        <h2><b>    Disadvantages</b></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous disadvantages to the student, the instructor, and the
 institution that must be considered when deliberating distance education.
      These disadvantages include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
        <h2><i> Costs of Entry and Ongoing Suppor</i></h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entry and ongoing support costs to quality distance education can be
 substantial. Distance education is a capital-intensive business. Investments in
 state-of-the-art technology, computers, virtual libraries, central servers and
 data networks, program development costs, ongoing technical support, equip
ment maintenance, hardware and software upgrades, and marketing can be
 expensive. Early results from a study conducted by the Western Cooperative
 for Educational Telecommunications on the costs of alternative forms of
 instructional delivery suggest that modes of delivery that rely on technology
 consistently cost more than face-to-face instruction (“The Costs of Teach
ing,” 2000).<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation commissioned studies at six universities
 to explore the financial costs and potential profitability of distance learning.
 The universities included Drexel University, Pace University, Pennsylvania
 State University, Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Illinois,
 and the University of Maryland-College Park. The researchers who con
ducted the studies concluded that “universities aren’t losing a lot of money on
 distance learning, but they aren’t making much, either. How well the
 programs appear to be doing depends, in part, on how their costs and
 revenues are defined” (Carr, 2001, p. A42). The costs of expanding
 programs are, in some cases, greater than anticipated. “Several distance
education leaders predict that some administrators will slow or stop their
 expansion into online learning as they develop a better sense of the costs”
 (Carr, p. A41). Robert E. Myers, executive vice president of the Univer
sity of Maryland’s University College, states that it is a myth that online
 learning is cheaper to produce and cheaper to deliver than face-to-face
 instruction (Carr). “After proclaiming that distance learning would save
 money, business schools are now discovering that ‘presence’ teaching is
 less expensive” (Ramanantsoa, 2001, p. 12).<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 One sobering reminder of the extent of the difficulty in implementing
 distance education is California Virtual University (CVU). CVU served as a
 clearinghouse for distance education programs for 98 public colleges and
 universities in California. Less than one year after its creation in 1997, CVU
 ceased operations. Although CVU faced a number of difficult issues, the
 decision to cease operations came after the venture’s partners—the state’s
 three public college systems and the Association of Independent Colleges—
 balked at putting up $1 million a year for three years to cover proposed
 operating costs for advertising and marketing (Blumenstyk, 1999; Young,
 2000, June 30)</p>

      <p> <i>Accreditation and Quality Assurance <br>
           According to Emmert (1997) in New England’s Journal of Higher
 Education and Economic Development:</i></p>
        <p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right: 20px">
         One hindrance to globalization of distance education is the issue
 of quality control—an area in which U.S. institutions begin with
 a disadvantage. Today, quality in American higher education is
 assessed by a complex, some say arcane, system of accreditation.
 The American accreditation system relies heavily upon the as
sessment of proxies for educational quality, such as hours spent
 in classrooms, student-to-faculty ratios, availability of facilities,
 and total resources spent on each student. Many other nations,

 particularly in Europe, approach quality control through compe
tency examinations for each discipline. Such competency assess
ment de-emphasizes time to degree, instruction mode, and the
 reputation of the institution providing the instruction. These
 nations therefore may be better positioned to adopt quality
 control in distance education. (p. 21)</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the Internet is an ideal breeding ground for diploma mills;
 a school could be fraudulent (Terry, 2000). Students must determine if a
 school is properly accredited.</p>
        <p><i> Concern for Online Course Quality</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall lack of standards in distance education is an issue (Imel,
 1996). There is no standard format for conducting an online class; therefore,
 course quality is a concern. In January, 2001, the American Federation of
 Teachers, one of the nation’s largest unions of educators, approved 14 quality
 standards for online colleges. The guidelines call for, among other principles,
 clear standards for content, technical support and counseling for students and
 faculty, and training for professors in effective online teaching methods (“Is
 Online Education Off Course?” 2001; Carnevale, 2001).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The quality of instructors in the online environment is an issue. Research
 has shown that some virtual universities require minimal qualifications when
 hiring instructors. “The instructors hired …need only a master’s degree; they
 do not enjoy tenure; they are replaceable cogs in a profit machine” (Stross,
 2001, p. 37). Hiring distinguished faculty is a luxury when evaluating the
 profitability of online education. “In fact, it is the opportunity to not hire full
time Ph.D.’s [sic] that makes the online university such an attractive financial
 proposition” (Stross, p.37).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In addition, business leaders, whose needs are often cited by promoters
 of online education, seem less certain about the quality of virtual degrees. In
 an October 2000 survey, 77% of human resource officers did not consider a
 degree from an online-only institution to be equivalent to a campus-based
 diploma (Press, Washburn & Broden, 2001). As participation in distance
 education by prestigious universities increases, and students with online degrees
 join the work force, business leaders will be able to reevaluate their position..<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Other critics argue that online learning could “facilitate the rise of a two
tiered educational system—prestigious campus-based diplomas for the chil
dren of elites, and mass-marketed online degrees for those less fortunate”
 (Press, Washburn & Broden, 2001, p.35)</p>
        <p><i>Labor Intensit</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distance education is more time-consuming (Guernsey, 1998); it is
 more labor intensive to teach an online class than it is a regular chalk-and
talk class (Bremner, 1998). It takes an average of 18 hours of personal time
 to create one hour of stand-alone Web-based instruction. This is a two- to
 fourfold increase over a traditional classroom lecture (Boettcher, 1998, as
 cited in Buikema & Ward). The conversion of curriculum from classroom
 to Internet is not easy or intuitive. “It is vastly harder than preparing a
 classroom course, 20 times the effort,” says Eli Noam, professor of
 economics and finance at Columbia Business School (Svetcov, 2000). In
 addition, there is usually more time spent corresponding (email, chatrooms)
 with students enrolled in an online course than in a traditional classroom
 (Buikema & Ward, 1999). An American Federation of Teacher’s survey
 revealed that 90% of those polled found a significant difference in
 preparation time necessary for the development of a distance learning
 course (“Is Online Education Off Course?” 2001). A recent University of
 Illinois study found that “high-quality online teaching is time- and labor
intensive” (Press, Washburn & Broden, 2001, p. 34)</p>
        <p><i>Effectiveness of Distance Education</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effectiveness of distance education is a hotly debated issue. An oft
cited report compiled by Thomas Russell in 1999 entitled The No Significant
 Difference Phenomenon indicates that learning outcomes of distance educa
tion students are similar to the learning outcomes of traditional on-campus
 students. Russell compiles this information from 355 research reports,
 summaries, and papers. This body of work also suggests that the attitudes and
 satisfaction of distance education students are generally positive. Other
 reviews of this body of evidence are more critical, arguing that there is no
 conclusive evidence to indicate this. Still others argue that the existing
 evidence on the effectiveness of distance education is generally inadequate
 because of experimental design flaws in the research (Van Dusen, 2000). In
 addition, other studies report that students see distance education as a
 convenient but less effective and less satisfying alternative for delivering
 education. Among academics, the debate continues to rage about the effec
tiveness of distance education.</p>
        <P><i> Commercial Versus Pedagogical Forces Driving Distance Learning</i></P>
        <p>
        ommercial Versus Pedagogical Forces Driving Distance Learning
 “While most educators support using technology to broaden educa
tional opportunities, a growing number fear that commercial rather than
 pedagogical considerations are driving the distance learning trend” (Press,

 Washburn & Broden, 2001, p.35). A number of universities are determin
ing how this technology can be used to generate a profit, rather than how
 this new technology can enhance the quality of learning. Many universi
ties have launched for-profit subsidiaries to market online courses, which
 has aroused strong opposition among professors. Virtual education threat
ens to shift control over the learning process from college educators to
 administrators and marketers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In addition, government officials, anticipating a boost in demand for
 post-secondary degrees, but reluctant to commit resources to public education
 through increased taxation, embrace distance learning as a way to expand
 “cheaply”—by using technology rather than bricks and mortar (Press,
 Washburn & Broden, 2001)</p>
        <p><i> Need For Faculty and Staff Training</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distance education requires a high level of instructor and staff training
 (Connell, 1998). Staff and faculty need to be trained in the use of technology
 (Hall, P., 1996). Faculty also need formal training in curriculum design and
 development, and in the development of techniques that promote learning for
 distant students</p>
        <p><i> Development of Educational Materials</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a need to develop world-class educational materials (Emmert,
 1997). Learning materials must be constructed that anticipate the learning
 problems of the isolated student and provide a wide range of activities that will
 support learning (Hall, P., 1996). Pedagogical adjustments are required,
 particularly in the areas of class participation and course-related activities
        </p>
        <p><i> Inaccessible Libraries</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most academic and corporate libraries provide remote access to materi
als, including journals, newspapers, magazines, and reference books. To
 serve distance learners, institutions will have to digitize local materials, such
 as course-related print sources. In addition, students need to have access to
 books and other print sources for research; a recurrent difficulty with the
 distance learning institutes is providing access to libraries. Consequently,
 there is a need to convert existing physical collections into digital form
 (Lynch, 2000)</p>
        <p><i>Faculty Compensation Issue</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are significant and substantial challenges to faculty compensation
 practices and existing norms of faculty development, including issues of
 promotion and tenure, release time, course load, course updating, publishing,
 faculty mentoring, and consistency across departments (U.S. Department of
 Education, 1999)</p>
          <p><i> Inadequate Infrastructure and Technical Support</i></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many institutions there is limited technological infrastructure to
 support distance education (U.S. Department of Education, 1997). Commu
nication systems can be unreliable (Hall, J., 1995) and equipment failures
 numerous. In addition, ongoing technical support for students and faculty is
 lacking or insufficient at many institutions.<br><i>
      Technology Limitations</i> <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vagaries of the Internet, such as dropped connections, network conges
tion, and software incompatibilities, are an issue. In addition, current band
width in most homes is limited to 56K; therefore, interactive video may be too
 choppy and distorted for student use. Performance limitations of the Internet
 inhibit the full use of rich multimedia content and communications.<br><i>
      Equity of Access For Students</i><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education requires that students have access to technology. The
 cost of equipment and access charges are issues for lower-income students.
 Inadequate Reflection, Conversation and Intellectual Dialogue
 Distance learning might be inadequate for deliberation and discourse
 among students, their instructors, and their peers. Distance education limits
 the extent to which students can reflectively browse in their subject matter
 with their peers and engage in exploratory discussion of their discipline
 (Curran, 1997). There is value in being at a university campus interacting
 socially and intellectually with fellow students and teachers (Plant, 1996).<br>
      <i>Maintaining Sufficient Student Contact</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 A fundamental problem with distance education is how to maintain
 sufficient student contact, including timely assistance and adequate perfor
mance feedback (Hall, J., 1995). The Further Education Funding Council, in
 visits to 50 colleges during the year 2000, and in surveys of 1,400 distance
 learning students, found inadequate guidance and support, leading to “unac
ceptably low” achievement rates. The report stated that most colleges do not
 take the initiative to keep in contact with students (Tysome, 2001).<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 On the other hand, recent research also indicates that through email and
 chatrooms, faculty are establishing better contact with students than through
 a traditional classroom environment.
12  Matthews<br><i>
      Possible Fraud in Authenticating Submissions</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 There is always the problem of authentication (Hall, P., 1996). How do
 we verify that persons sending assignments and tests are who they say they
 are? Distance education offers a unique venue for academic dishonesty and
 requires a software infrastructure to support authentication.<br>
      <i>Legal Issues of Intellectual Property Rights</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Traditionally, teachers have been considered the owners of lectures and
 course materials. The market potential of online education has led numerous
 schools to attempt to claim these rights, prompting protest from faculty
 organizations (Press, Washburn & Broden, 2001). In addition, syllabi or
 course outlines on the Web might be absorbed into the public domain and
 could be used and adapted by others (Gallick, 1998). Ownership of intellec
tual property is a source of debate.<br>
      <i>
          Inadequate Financial Aid Policies</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 There are restrictions on financial aid availability for distance learners
 (Selingo, 1998). The “50% rule” prohibits the granting of federal aid to
 students who are not in a classroom seat at least 50% of their academic
 program. This class-time requirement has effectively barred online colleges
 from arranging federally backed financial aid for enrolled students.
 Global Issues<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 When looking at distance education from a global perspective, trans
lation remains an issue. In addition, because of differences in culture, the
 content of the educational materials, the values implicit in the materials,
 and the underlying assumptions about educational processes need to be
 reviewed and might need to be transformed (Hall, P., 1996). Underdevel
oped countries might not even have access to technology. In a keynote
 address concerning global distance education to officials from 30 nations,
 Jacques Hallak, assistant director general for education of UNESCO,
 states, “There are political concerns about sovereignty and control, impor
tant differences in education policy and regulatory environments and in
 the ways education institutions are chartered and governed, as well as the
 realities of language, culture, and geographic perspective” (Young, 2000,
 September 29, p. A46).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 It is a dynamic time for post-secondary education institutions facing the
 opportunities and challenges brought by technological innovation. There is
 no question that the use of technology has advantages and disadvantages for
 both users and providers of distance education

            <h1><b>THE PLAYERS IN DISTANCE EDUCATION</b></h1>
        </center>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education in the United States is offered by individual institu
tions as well as a range of new, some may say “unconventional” providers of
 education. According to the U.S. Department of Education (1999), other
 providers include:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 30px"> Consortia or collaboratives that represent cooperative pooling and
 sharing arrangements among institutions (typically, traditional col
leges and universities). In these arrangements, multiple institutions
 join together to provide distance education on a statewide or regional
 basis. The authority to award degrees and credits, however, remains
 with each member institution and does not shift to the consortium….
 Contracted or brokered arrangements that are configurations of
 institutions, faculty, or other providers brought together solely for
 the purpose of delivering distance education. In contrast to consortia
 or collaboratives, the authority to award degrees and credits rests
 with the contracting or organizing entity, not with the originating
 institution….
 Virtual universities, or institutions that offer most or all of their
 instruction via technological means and are distinguished by their
 nearly exclusiv</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             A sampling of the various types of players in distance education in higher
 education follows.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Many states have active distance education programs. For example, the
 Education Network of Maine is an independent arm of the Maine university
 system. Colorado established the Colorado Electronic Community College as
 the state’s 12th community college (The Chronicle of Higher Education, 1995,
 December 8, as cited in U.S. Department of Education, 1997). Among the
 other notable education systems are EdNet in Oregon, the Iowa Communica
tions Network, the TeleLinking Network in Kentucky, and BadgerNet in
 Wisconsin (U.S. Department of Education, 1997).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 California State University (CSU) is one of the leading practitioners in
 distance education (Primary Research Group, 1997). CSU is the largest
 system of state colleges in the country, with 23 campuses and 255,500 full
time students. CSU embraces the digital revolution, including the virtual
 classroom and online applications. To finance educational technology, CSU
 is proposing the California Educational Technology Initiative—a 10-year, $4
 billion revenue partnership with four private corporations: Microsoft Corpo
ration, Hughes Electronics Corporation, GTE Corporation, and Fujitsu Ltd.
 (Gallick, 1998). This initiative will have a major impact on distance education
 at CSU.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Universities, such as Columbia, Cornell, Duke, NYU, Temple, Mary
land, and Nebraska, have all established “for-profit” subsidiaries to market
 distance education programs. Many more schools are collaborating with
 commercial and nontraditional providers. For instance, Columbia Business
 School, the University of Chicago, Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon
 University, and the London School of Economics and Political Science have
 agreed to develop content for Cardean University, a virtual school for
 business education (a division of UNext) launched by Oracle CEO Lawrence
 Ellison and former junk-bond magnate Michael Milken (Terry, 2000).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Other states and institutions have joined together in cooperatives and
 consortia to support and offer distance education. The Committee on Institu
tional Cooperation is an example of such a cooperative. It consists of 12 large
 institutions including Pennsylvania State University, the University of Iowa,
 Ohio State University, the University of Minnesota, the University of Wis
consin, and the University of Illinois (The Chronicle of Higher Education,
 1995, December 8, as cited in U.S. Department of Education, 1997).<br>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 30px">As more colleges consider collaborations as a way to move quickly
 into distance education, two notable models are Western Governors
 University and the Southern Regional Education Board’s Elec
tronic Campus. Both span huge geographic regions, but their
 approaches and records diverge (Carnevale, 2000, May 19, p. A53).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In the west, 13 members of the Western Governors Association created
 Western Governors University (WGU), a degree-granting virtual university
 (Ashworth, 1996). WGU has administrative headquarters in Salt Lake City,
 Utah, and academic headquarters in Colorado (Gallick, 1998). The university
 was founded in 1997 and began enrolling students in September, 1998. This
 virtual university has no campus and relies on computers and other technol
ogy, such as interactive video, to deliver instruction (U.S. Department of
 Education, 1997). Students can gain knowledge in courses offered by 40
 colleges and universities in 22 states and Guam. WGU brings together, under
 a single academic banner, courses created at a variety of member institutions,
 and awards degrees under its own name. WGU promises to revolutionize
 higher education by offering degrees—based on a new, competency-based
 testing system—that will compete with those offered by existing colleges.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 On the other hand, WGU found, as have other players, that entering into
 the distance education environment can be arduous. “WGU…has failed to
 meet any of its enrollment targets, is running a deficit, and lacks accreditation”
 (Carnevale, 2000, May 19, p. A53). Today, WGU enrolls 200 degree-seeking
 students. When first conceived, WGU anticipated 500 degree-seeking stu
dents by the year 2000 (Carnevale, 2000, May 19; Carr, 2001). Utah’s auditor

 general released an audit of WGU, criticizing it for low enrollment and poor
 performance in competing with other distance education programs (Carnevale,
 2000, October 6). WGU also found that gaining accreditation is a slow
 process. After two years, in November, 2000, WGU was awarded candidate
 status in the accreditation process. WGU expects to gain accreditation after
 further evaluation, which typically takes an additional two to five years. In
 WGU’s favor, other virtual universities, such as Jones International Univer
sity and Regents College, have already gained accreditation. In addition,
 Regents, like WGU, also awards degrees through competency-based assess
ments (Carnevale, 2000, December 15).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The Southern Regional Electronic Campus is a consortium of 16 south
ern states. It is made up of more than 262 colleges and universities that enroll
 20,000 students in distance education courses. The Electronic Campus lists
 more than 3,200 courses (it began with 40 in 1998), and 102 degree programs
 (Carnevale, 2000, May 19). The Electronic Campus is a loose collective that
 started out providing members little more than a common Web site to
 publicize online offerings. Students earn course credits and degrees from the
 individual participating institutions. The Electronic Campus has a policy of
 not setting strict rules for its member institutions. It is essentially a free-trade
 zone where states can develop their own online course material and then share
 it with other states. Its purpose is to share resources and help market the
 courses that its institutions create.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In contrast to WGU, the Southern Regional Electronic Campus “hasn’t
 attempted to reshape academe or to compete with anyone, but rather, to give
 students easy access to online courses offered by participating colleges”
 (Carnevale, 2000, May 19, p. A53). Many new collaborations are being
 modeled after the Southern Regional Electronic Campus rather than WGU.
 Officials of WGU announced in November, 1998, that they were estab
lishing a distance education consortium with Britain’s well-known Open
 University. The new organization, called the Governors Open University
 System, serves as a front end for the two universities, and students enrolled
 in either institution are able to take courses through the other (McCollum,
 1998). In 1999, Britain’s Open University opened a new sister institution in
 America—the United States Open University.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In higher education, the highest-profile virtual college is the University
 of Phoenix, which has a complete curriculum and a sophisticated delivery
 system (O’Leary, 2000). Started in 1989, the University of Phoenix is the
 largest private school in the U.S., enrolling more than 75,000 students; 13,800
 students from 25 countries take online courses. In September, 1999, the
 Apollo Group, parent company of the University of Phoenix, raised $70

 million from investors on Wall Street in a stock offering tied directly to the
 distance education unit. It is the first test of a public offering of stock in a
 distance learning institution. Table 1 lists a few virtual universities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Investors are pouring millions into Web education. So far the biggest
 player is Michael Milken, his brother Lowell, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison.
 They own Knowledge Universe, a venture hatchery for education and
 training companies. The Washington Post Company is also knee-deep in
 edu-ventures, including the ownership of Kaplan College. Wall Street
 magnate Herbert Allen of Allen & Co. has earmarked $20 million to
 launch and sustain Global Education Network, a clearinghouse of courses
 from America’s top colleges, including Brown, Wellesley, and Williams.
 (Svetcov, 2000). In 2000, billionaire Michael Saylor donated $100 mil
lion toward the creation of an online university that will offer an “Ivy
 League” level of education free of charge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Technologies for an advanced Internet are now being actively studied for
 use in higher education by a three-way partnership that includes government,
 industry, and academia (Houweling, 2000). The “Internet2” project focuses
 on new technologies and applications and on the convergence, or the unified
 delivery of services such as text, voice, video, and data. Since it began in
 October, 1996, the Internet2 project has grown to include over 150 universi
ties, more than 50 companies, and dozens of other organizations focused on
 advanced networking (Houweling, 2000).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 As distance learning becomes a serious alternative to the standard
 classroom environment, enormous opportunities and dilemmas present them
selves for the players in distance education. Software developers, telecommu
nications companies, hardware makers, publishers, Internet and Web service
 providers, and many other technology- and education-based services are
 developing systems for this emerging market that capitalize on the special
 capabilities of different technologies

        <center><h1><b> CONCLUSION</b></h1></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The ever-accelerating growth in information technology and the prolif
eration of distance education are exciting developments in higher education
 that could bring about some of the most profound changes to the ways we
 teach and learn. They provide extraordinary opportunities to transform the
 when, where, and how of what we teach (Matthews, 1999). Taking a class and
 ultimately receiving a college degree are being added to the list of stay-at
home electronic activities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Educators have the opportunity to define, design, and manage effective
 and robust teaching and learning systems, programs, and courses. It is no
 longer a question of whether or not the new higher education will develop, but
 how fast it will occur (Connick, 1997). Adopting new approaches to education
 is not an option—it is imperative. No generation will have the opportunity that
 we have to put a mark on the look of education in the future. Technology has
 penetrated all aspects of education and will change it dramatically</p>
