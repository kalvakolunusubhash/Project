                <h1 style="padding-top: 40px;"><b> The Rise of Strategic Thinking</b></h1></center>
        <hr>
        <p> The concept of strategy was born in military campaigns whose results, whether
 good or bad, were largely the product of the minds of strategists. From ancient
 times, much has been said about great military commanders and their strategies.
 The word strategic comes from the Greek stratego, which literally means
 general. In the classic division of war into operational, tactical, and strategic
 aspects, strategy is linked to planning, to the broader environment and the
 longest time frame. Even though its meaning has changed over time, since the
 Napoleonic wars it has encompassed military, political and economic dimen
sions</p>
        <p> The first writings that contain thoughts about what today we would call strategic
 thinking go back to antiquity, authored by Greeks and Romans. Even in the
 Bible, there are passages where one can perceive the strategies used to win
 conflicts. Perhaps the oldest text that deals systematically with this matter is
 “The art of war,” written by Sun Tzu (1983) of China in the fourth century, B.C.
 This book appeared in the West in the 18th century and became well
 disseminated by the end of the 20th century. At the time the text was written,</p>
        <p> China was the scene of constant warring among feudal lords. Sun Tzu traveled
 throughout the country disseminating his teachings, as a kind of consultant
 (Hurst, 2001). The Art of War deals with principles of a general nature, which
 aid a sovereign in winning wars. For Sun Tzu, the art of war is governed by five
 factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b> Moral Law:</b>the degree to which the people are dedicated to and trust
                their government;</li>
            <li><b>The Sky:</b>the climatic conditions;</li>
            <li><b>The Earth:</b>the conditions of the land, of distances;</li>
            <li><b>The chief:</b>represents the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence,
 courage, and righteousness;</li>
            <li><b>The Method and discipline:</b> the correct deployment of the army,
                supplies and cost controls</li></ul>
            <p> The book strongly emphasizes the need for generals to know themselves and
 their adversaries well, which is summed up in the phrase: “If you know your
 enemy, you do not need to fear the result of a hundred battles.” Another aspect
 that he stresses is the importance of avoiding direct confrontation, where force
 meets force. On the contrary, the adversary should be convinced to not to want
 to fight: “The greatest merit consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without
 fighting.” Sun Tzu’s writings had a lot of influence on the thinking of business
 people and there are several extensions of his ideas which focus on different
 aspects of business in the literature. His influence was particularly important for
 authors seeking guidelines and declarations of principle devoted to business
 strategy. Among the most noteworthy are the authors who originated a school
 of strategic thought called the “school of positioning” which flourished in the
 1980s, and in which Michael Porter is usually included. This and other schools
 of strategic thinking will be examined later in this chapter</p>
            <p> Niccolo Machiavelli’s most famous work,The Prince (Maquiavel, 1976), was
 a kind of manual of politic science, written in the 16th century. This was during
 the Italian Renaissance, a time of extreme turbulence, when kingdoms were
 warring among themselves and many struggled to govern them. Machiavelli’s
 thinking, often expressed in the “Machiavellian” phrase “the ends justify the
 means”, had broad repercussions in political and military thought over the years
 and in 20th century business ideas as well. Notions about how to form alliances
 and to deal with enemies appear throughout his work: “The prince should become the chief and protector of his less powerful neighbors, work to weaken
 the stronger and avoid the entry of a prince stronger than he at all costs”.
 Machiavelli exalted governors who were alert and ready to fight decisively:
 “Princes lose their states when they dedicate themselves more to voluptuous
ness than to arms.” Audacity is another virtue he extols in his work: “I am of the
 opinion that it is better to be daring than prudent”.</p>
            <p> Machiavelli influenced not just politics but business literature as well, especially
 in recommendations for executive actions. This vision is found among thinkers
 included in the “school of entrepreneurship,” which highlights the role of the
 (CEO –Chief Executive Officer) in formulating strategy.</p>
            <p> The concept of strategy focused on military matters arose in the 18th century
 amidst the valorization of thought which oriented the ideas of Illuminism.
 Influenced by the success of scientific principles in explaining physical phenom
ena, theoreticians examined military successes with the same criteria, trying to
 distill the principles of strategy.</p>
            <p> These theoreticians were influenced by Frederick the Great of Prussia who was
 successful with small, well-trained armies. Scholars of the time perceived
 mathematical and geometric principles in these victories.</p>
            <p> However, at the end of the 18th century, Napoleon’s armies crushed the armies
 mounted along Prussian lines, disorienting theoreticians who struggled to
 explain what had happened in order to create new principles.</p>
            <p>In this context, two theoreticians who studied Napoleon’s successes arose: the
 Prussian general Karl von Clausewitz (1780-1831), still famous today both in
 military and business circles, and the French-Swiss general Antoine-Henri de
 Jomini (1779-1869), who although very influential in his day, has now been
 nearly forgotten.</p>
            <p> Of those who wrote interpretively and contemporaneously of Napoleon’s
 successes, Von Clausewitz’s works had the greatest impact on concepts of
 military strategy. His main contributions were in understanding the relationship
 between theory and practice and his vision of war as a dynamic process. For
 him, strategic theory should have a descriptive rather than prescriptive nature,
 i.e. there is no “recipe” for strategic success; rather it is possible to learn from
 observing outside experiences. The study of strategy, with a descriptive focus,
 aids in training the judgment and intuition of the commanders, but it cannot be
 used as a basis for action, since command is seen as something essentially
 creative. Decisions have to be made quickly in situations which are essentially
 unique and thus it would be hard to prescribe actions beforehand. On the other  hand, the commander who learns from former experiences can use them in a
 rational or even intuitive manner to make better and faster decisions.</p>
            <p> Clausewitz’s book, On War, has been used by military academies since its
 publications and as business literature since the 1980s.</p>
            <p> Curiously, de Jomini was more influential in his time than Von Clausewitz.
 Today, however, few remember his ideas. For Jomini, there were scientific
 principles of military strategy that not only should be prescribed, but should be
 followed. Since there were many commanders who were avid to discover the
 secrets of Napoleon’s military successes, the idea that they could be trans
formed into a collection of recipes, which could be used repeatedly, was
 extremely attractive. His was, therefore, a prescriptive approach. De Jomini
 considered that the principles of war were always valid, independently of the
 situation or the technology employed. His ideas remained in vogue in military
 circles until the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
            <p> However, with the advent of World War I, the reality of its bloody combat
 overthrew his “immutable principles.” In his writings, de Jomini defended the
 effectiveness of massive frontal attacks and argued that this was valid indepen
dently of the technology employed. These ideas of direct attacks had their basis
 in the era of muskets and became a lot more expensive with the advent of
 repeating rifles. But with machine guns, widely disseminated in the first world
 war, direct attacks became prohibitive (to illustrate, there were more than a
 million casualties just between the Battles of Somme and Verdun). Therefore
 technology deeply affected the supposed validity of his principles.
 Ideas of military strategy were transposed to the business world during the
 second half of the 20th century, and the use of the same concepts and terms was
 common.</p>
            <p> The use of analogy, especially taking cases from military strategy, is very
 frequent in the study of business. Nevertheless, there should be a certain
 caution since this is a resource to facilitate comprehension that should not be
 taken literally. As was said regarding Von Clausewitz, analogies should be used
 as a source of inspiration.</p>
            <p> The lines of thinking of the previously cited authors, von Clausewitz and de
 Jomini, influenced the rise of currents of strategic thinking devoted to the world
 of business. They can be grouped generically in two ways: descriptive and
 prescriptive. Alternating between these two basic ideas, Mintzberg, Ahlstrand
 and Lampel (1998) identified 10 different currents of strategic business thinking
 detailed in the following</p>
            <center><h1><b> Investigating the Concept of Strategy</b></h1></center>
            <hr>
            <p> What is understood by strategy has not remained the same over time, but has
 run a long course to arrive at the present. What factors should be considered
 in developing a strategy? How to analyze these factors? How to develop a
 strategy? Should strategy be planned or generated as facts develop? How to
 view strategy? Is there a recipe for successful strategies? These questions, and
 others that come up, will be discussed in this chapter and in this book.</p>
            <p> Strategy as a subject for business arose in the 1950s and flourished in the 60s,
 70s and 80s. There was a period of apogee, and with the birth of the so-called
 “New Economy”, it came to be strongly questioned. Then with the develop
ments in the wake of the bankruptcy of the Internet companies it came back into
 view. From all we have seen up to now, the importance of having a better
 understanding of strategy is clear.</p>
            <p> The concept of strategy, in business as well as the military realm where it
 originated, has several approaches and remains in constant evolution. There are
 different ways to understand strategic thinking. Thus, definitions of strategy will
 be different. Instead of trying to define strategy, various factors within the
 concept of strategy and various views on the subject will be presented.</p>
            <h1><b>The Evolution of Strategic Thinking</b></h1>
            <hr>
            <p>We have already seen how the concept of strategy had a military origin and two
 of the thinkers who had a major influence on strategic theory: von Clausewitz,
 who adopted the descriptive approach and de Jomini whose writings are of aprescriptive nature.</p>
 <p>According to Hurst (2001) there is a continuum of strategic thinking that ranges
 from description to prescription, the two basic ideas presented earlier. In this
 context, Mintzberg & Lampel (1999) listed 10 different “schools” in one of the
 most well-known taxonomies about strategic thinking. For them, they signify
 different processes for determining strategy—all parts of the same process.
 Among the schools of thought that formulate analytic and prescriptive strategy
 (the “ought to” schools, which aim to instruct), Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and
 Lampel locate the following Design, Planning, and Positioning.</p>
            <p><b>Design (Strategy as a process of conception).</b> This school views the
 process of forming strategy essentially as a fit between strengths and
 weaknesses and threats and opportunities from the external environment.
 This was the dominant thinking in the 60s, and beginning of the 70s.
 Among the representative authors of this school are Philip Selznick,
 Alfred Chandler, and Ken Andrews.</p>
            <p><b>Planning (Strategy as a formal process).</b> Developed concomitantly
 with the school of Design, the school of Planning came into being with Igor
 Ansoff in 1965, and had its apogee in the 70s. Russell L. Ackoff is another
 representative author of this school. Although it lost some importance at
 the beginning of the 80s, it remains an important school.</p>
            <p><b>Positioning (Strategy as an analytical process).</b>  The school of
 Positioning predominated in the 1980s, thanks mainly to the work of
 Michael Porter. This is descended directly from the ideas about military
 strategy of various authors, among them Sun Tzu. It is based on the idea
 that strategy can be reduced to some generic positions, which can be
 identified by analyzing the situation of the industry (industry here used in
 the sense of a sector of activities). In this view, the strategist is, above all,
 an analyst</p>
            <p> Among the schools of thought about formulating strategy of a descriptive
 nature (the “is” schools) which seek to inspire the imagination rather than to
 instruct, Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and Lampel (1998) list the following: Entrepre
neurship, Cognition, Learning, Power, Culture, Environment, and Configura
tion.</p>
            <p><b>Entrepreneurship (Strategy as a visionary process).</b> Like the Design
 school the school of Entrepreneurship focuses the process on the CEO —
 Chief Executive Officer. However, in a very different manner, it bases
 the process of creative intuition in a visionary leader and in the capacity
 to control and implement his/her ideas.</p>
            <p><b>Cognitive (Strategy as a mental process).</b>This school appeared in the
 80s and is still developing today. It is based on the ability to understand
 people’s mental processes and how reality is perceived. More recently,
 the focus has been on a more subjective, interpretive, or constructivist
 approach to creating strategy.</p>
            <p><b> Learning (Strategy as an emerging process).</b>Developing in parallel
 with other schools, and in a certain sense taking on a position of
 challenging the dominant school at every turn, it has an incremental view
 of implementing strategy. Strategy is seen as an emerging process,
 strategists can be present everywhere in the company, and the formulation
 and implementation of strategy are not separate.</p>
            <p><b>Power (Strategy as a negotiating process).</b>  In this school, not among
 the largest, strategy is based on power. In a micro approach, power is
 viewed as being internally disputed in the companies in a natural political
 process involving negotiation, persuasion, and bargaining. In a macro
 approach, it views the company as an entity that uses its power over others
 to form partnerships, joint ventures, or other interrelationships to negoti
ate collective strategies in its own interest.</p>
            <p><b>Cultural (Strategy as a social process).</b> This school, equally small,
 considers strategy as a social process based in culture that has to do with
 common interests and integration. Most of the school’s writings have to
 do with the influence of culture as inhibitors of more important strategic
 changes.</p>
            <p><b>Environmental (Strategy as a reactive process).</b> This school seeks to
 understand the degree of freedom a company has to move within its
 environment, as well as to understand the demands it makes on the
 organizations. Included here are Contingency Theory (which studies the
 expected responses of companies under certain environmental condi
tions) and Institutional Theory (which studies the institutional pressures
 organizations face).</p>
            <p><b>Configuration (Strategy as a process of transformation).</b>This is the
 school of strategic thinking in a more inclusive and integrative practice.
 There are two aspects to this school which are mutually complementary:
 one is more academic, the other is professional, with nuances of consult
ing. The first, more descriptive aspect, understands the company as a
 configuration for each situation, integrating the different views of each
 school, all capable of being used, according to each case. The second,
 which is more prescriptive, views changes as dramatic transformations
 from one state to another.</p>
            <img src="img1.png">
            <p> With the view that various schools can live together at different stages of the
 process of formulating strategy, Mintzberg and Lampel (1999) point out how
 each of the schools can contribute to a vision of the process as summarized in
 Table 1.2.</p>
            <p> To complement the classification they proposed, Mintzberg & Lampel (1999)
 point to new approaches to the formation of strategies that combine aspects
 from the 10 schools as shown in Table 1.3. This table reinforces the idea that</p>
            <img src="img2.png">
            <img src="img3.png">
            <p> schools of strategic thought can be complementary since they can contribute in
 a specific way to these new approaches, showing that ideas about strategy
 continue to evolve, without, however, disregarding earlier thinking.</p>
            <p> In addition to these schools and approaches there are other currents of strategic
 thinking that are gaining visibility, according to Hurst (2001) and focus on
 implementation rather than formulation (although the separation between these
 two stages is more of a didactic nature than what really happens):</p>
            <ul>
                <li> The Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan & Norton, 1992, 1996, 2000), which
 focuses on iterative processes, discipline, and a search for means for
 companies to develop performance indicators that encompass aspects in
 addition to the financial</li>
                <li> Administration by self-control (Drucker, 1974), which considers that the
 final goal of administration is to produce a self-governing community; this
 requires productive work, feedback for self-control, and continuous
 learning.</li>
            <li> Creative destruction (Foster & Kaplan, 2001), which shows that long
lasting companies have a lower than average market performance, which
 negates the hypothesis that companies survive as long as they perform
 better than their competitors. In this view, the greatest gains are obtained
 by companies that are industry entrants. Thus, companies need to undergo
 a process of creative destruction in order to cease being mere followers
 of average market performance.</li>
                <li> Rupture or disruptive models (Christensen & Overdorf, 2000) show the
 inability of companies to reinvent themselves. According to these authors,
 small new entrants in an industry dethrone the old leaders with disruptive
 business models, based on new technologies, which in turn lead to
 resources, processes, and values that allow them to be exploited ad
equately. The rupture is based much more on these factors than on new
 technologies which are not often radically innovative.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus, strategic thinking continues to evolve</p>
            <h1><b>Strategy and Competition: The Deliberative and
 Revolutionary Nature of Strategy</b></h1>
            <hr>
            <P>The need for strategy is linked to the existence of competition, whether to win
 a war or to conquer the market. But this is a necessary condition and is not
 sufficient to explain what strategy is.</P>
            <p> There is competition among species in nature for survival, but we can’t speak
 of a strategy for natural selection. The random variations produced in species
 will adapt differently to the environment and only the best adapted will survive.
 Speaking of the processes of nature, it is interesting to note that Gause’s
 “principle of competitive exclusion” can be verified in experimentation with
 elementary living beings. According to this principle, when beings of the same
 species are isolated in an environment with limited resources, none of them
 survive. However, if there are beings from different species, survival is possible.
 In other words, two species that compete in an identical manner cannot exist
 in the same environment. The richer the environment is in terms of resources,
 the more species there will be, and also more competition (Henderson, 1989).</p>
            <p> What differences and similarities are there between what happens in nature and
 what happens in the business world?<br> As in nature, in the business environment, there cannot be companies compet
ing in the same way for the same market, even thought this is not evident at the
 first glance <br> Therefore, there is a similarity here.
 <br>However competition existed before strategy. But there is a basic difference
 between natural competition and strategy. Natural competition is evolutionary,
 governed by the laws of probability; strategy is revolutionary, governed by  reason and imagination, aiming at accelerating the pace of change. Revolution
ary here is used in the sense of breaking with the natural course of things, in the
 sense of making deliberate interventions.
<br> Thus for Henderson (1989), strategy is a deliberate search for a plan of action
 that will develop a competitive advantage for the business and putting this plan
 into practice.
<br> This search necessarily begins with an understanding of whom and where you
 are and that your goal is to increase the scope of the advantage a company will
 have in competing for the market.
<br> Note that strategy has two perspectives: that of a plan, and also the execution
 of this plan. This view is also defended by Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and Lampel
 (1998). For these authors, strategy is a plan for directing activities toward a
 future: those who develop it desire to shape favorably for themselves. On the
 other hand, there is the notion that strategy is equally linked to the execution of
 the plan, to what really was done. Thus, these authors understand that strategy
 is a pattern that is followed in a consistent way over time.</p>
            <h1><b> Distinguishing What Strategy Is</b></h1>
            <hr>
            <p> Some ideas have been confused with the concept of strategy, which makes a
 discussion about them necessary in order to move ahead with the study
 proposed in this book.
 <br> For Porter (1996), when faced with ever more aggressive competition in ever
 more rapidly changing markets, companies learn to be flexible, to respond
 quickly to competition and to changes in the markets. The dissemination of
 better managerial practices, which seek gains in efficiency, has taken on
 increasing importance. However, this has led companies to confuse operational
 efficiency with strategy. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between the
 two.
<br> While operational efficiency is necessary in a competitive scenario, it often
 becomes a condition for companies to participate in a market, and does not
 constitute a form of strategy, nor can it replace it. In terms of competitive
 advantage, the company can surpass its rivals just by managing to establish a
 difference that it can maintain. To this end, the company should look to deliver
 value to clients in a different form, to create value for the company at a lower
 cost, or to do both.</p>
            <img src="img4.png">
            <p> First, before a discussion about operational efficiency and strategy, it is
 necessary to distinguish efficiency from effectiveness (Figure 1.1).
 Efficiency is a measure of the performance of the process of conversion of
 inputs into outputs, while effectiveness is a measure of the degree to which the
 outputs satisfy requirements. Efficiency is related with “doing things in the right
 way”, such as using resources well, with a focus internal to activities. Effective
ness is related to “doing the right things” obtaining results in accord with goals,
 with a focus on the outside environment (Drucker, 1963; Laurindo, Carvalho,
 and Shimizu, 2003).
 <br>For Porter (1996), operational efficiency means executing similar activities
 better than the competitors. To achieve efficiency, several managerial tools
 have been developed, for example TQM (total quality management),
 benchmarking, outsourcing, partnering, and reengineering. These tools are
 important in a competitive environment; however they are not sufficient to
 replace a company’s strategy.
 <br>  On the other hand, a strategic position means carrying out activities which are
 different from those of rivals or to execute similar activities in a different way.
 One of the problems of focusing just on operational efficiency is the fact that few
 companies manage to compete successfully for an extended period of time if
 they base themselves in this aspect. Therefore, operational efficiency is not
 enough, since there is rapid dissemination of the best practices, which are
 replicable by other companies and which become commercialized products. A
 second reason is because the larger the number of companies that adopt
 practices such as benchmarking and outsourcing or any other tool, the more
 they become similar, thus making it impossible for some of them to stand out
 among the rest and thus they leave the field vanquished.</p>
            <p> Porter argues that a generalized focus on operational efficiency explains the
 wave of consolidations and mergers in certain industries. Since the companies
 lack a strategic vision and base themselves solely on an evaluation of opera
tional performance, they do not find an option for growth other than buying,
 being bought, or merging.
 <br>In turn, Campbell and Alexander (1997) argue that often strategic planning
 does not result in effective action. For them, this is the result of failing to
 understand what it means to develop strategy.
<br> First, they argue that there is a failure to differentiate between purposes and
 constraints. Purposes are the reason for the organization’s existence, what the
 company desires to do. Constraints are what an organization needs to do to
 survive. Another problem resides in how a company can implement strategy.
<br> Finally, there is the expectation that good planning will result in better strategies.
 For these authors, however, developing a good strategy should be based in a
 real understanding of the benefits to the company of having well established
 purposes, as well as in seeking to generate greater value than its competitors.
<br> Another issue that Campbell and Alexander point out is the definition of
 company goals, which directly affects the development of strategy. Statements
 about providing shareholders with a higher return; increasing value to clients;
 higher-than-market-levels salaries and carrier opportunities for their collabo
rators do not help to define strategy, because they are just new ways of stating
 the universal goal of all companies to develop and maintain competitive
 advantage. Many executives erroneously believe that satisfying the stakehold
ers is a goal that leads to correct strategy; generating value for the stakeholders
 is not an objective, but an economic constraint on a company’s actions. The
 reason for this is that companies will not have the loyalty of their stakeholders
 (clients, stockholders, suppliers, and collaborators) if these do not perceive
 that the company is adding a value at least equal to that provided by its
 competitors. Achieving objectives depends on managers’ ability to develop
 appropriate strategies, since if they can’t establish a strategy, the goals will be
 discarded as nonviable. Similarly, these authors contend that a strategy is only
 viable if there are tactical actions that make its implementation possible.
<br> Christensen (1997) stresses that another problem in elaborating strategy lies in
 the fact that this activity is not usually exercised every day, which means that it
 is not at the heart of the executives’ daily activities. Strategy should be coherent
 with the environment of the company and company resources should be aligned
 with executing this strategy. Christensen believes that, in general, there is a
 deficiency in the connection and alignment between the process of conceiving
 strategy and the process of implementing it</p>
            <p> Porter’s (1996) view that strategy differs fundamentally from the search for
 operational efficiency is in part corroborated by Hamel (1996), who defends
 the idea that changes of an incremental nature are not enough for the success
 of a strategy for the majority of companies. Small cost reductions and marginal
 improvements in quality and in delivery times are some of Hamel’s examples of
 incrementalism. All these implicitly seek operational efficiency. The author
 states that making strategy implies assuming more revolutionary postures,
 which can affect the way companies operate in a more significant manner.
<br> Likewise, there is a similarity between the positions and questioning of
 Campbell and Alexander (1997) and Christensen (1997) about the need to
 understand the difference between strategy and strategic planning. Hamel
 affirms that strategic planning in general is not in fact strategic, since he
 interprets the traditional processes for developing strategy to obliterate the
 revolutionary stance which he advocates. Strategy should be a result of
 “revolutionary” and “subversive” processes that are easier to find in small
 companies, which are not the traditional market leaders. The leaders define the
 rules in force for an industry, but revolutionary companies have the potential to
 reinvent these rules.
<br> It is necessary to distinguish strategy from the quest for operational efficiency,
 as well as to understand the differences that separate the concepts of strategy
 and strategic planning processes.</p>
            <h1><b> Strategy as a Choice Among Options</b></h1>
            <hr>
            <p> For Porter (1996), a competitive strategy means choosing a different arrange
ment of activities to deliver a package of unique value, thus staking out a
 strategic position. Strategic positioning can be realized based in three distinct
 sources that are not mutually exclusive: the variety of products and services,
 meeting the needs of a certain group of consumers, and the particularities of
 accessibility of a specific group of consumers.
<br> For positioning based on the variety of products and services, the main idea is
 to chose a range of products and services to be offered and to develop activities
 which will allow them to be produced in the best way possible.
<br> When positioning is based on the needs of a group of consumers, differences
 in terms of obtaining an advantageous positioning only occur when the set of
 activities that allows specific services is also differentiated. Note that these
 specific needs can be anything from a greater sensitivity to price, to products  with specific characteristics — differentiation in need does not translate into a
 meaningful position, unless the arrangement of activities to satisfy clients is also
 different.
<br> Differences in accessibility can lead to strategic positioning, even when
 consumer needs are not different from those of other customers, but when the
 means to reach customers demands a differentiated set of activities. This can
 occur due to geographic factors, the scale of production, or other factors which
 require a specific manner of accessing customers.
<br> For Porter therefore, within this context, the essence of strategy is the creation
 of a unique, valuable position, involving the choice of an internal arrangement
 of activities that allows the company to differentiate itself from its rivals.
 <br>In a similar fashion, Markides (1999) understands the essence of strategy to lie
 in the company’s choosing a position that it can sustain as its own. In addition,
 developing strategy is a process of elaborating questions, generating alterna
tives, and making choices.
<br> These issues and choices involve three dimensions: which customers to focus
 on, what products to offer, and how to realize these activities in an efficient
 manner. The strategic positioning of companies comes from their responses to
 these three questions, and if they are differentiated, will lead the companies to
 success.
 Choosing a unique position still is not sufficient to guarantee a sustainable
 advantage, since the competitors can imitate this behavior and aim at the same
 strategic positioning. However, in assuming some options, the companies have
 to let go of others, under the risk of not being successful in any of them.
 Therefore, equilibrium between exclusive alternatives (trade-offs) must be
 sought, without which the companies will not arrive at a sustainable advantage.
<br> The need for these trade-offs is based in three reasons for Porter: to maintain
 consistency in image or reputation, compatibility with the nature of the activities
 themselves, and limitations on internal coordination and in the control of
 activities.
 <br>To maintain a consistent image or reputation, it is important that customers not
 be confused, but perceive that they always receive the same kind of value.
 The compatibility of the characteristics themselves should be preserved to
 facilitate the more homogenous use of equipment, as well as to meet the
 demands for capabilities, behavior, and training of employees and managers.
 <br>The existence of limits on the internal coordination and control means that the
 company has to make choices in line with its priorities, under penalty of not  achieving adequate performance, if it divides its efforts among many alterna
tives.
<br> Therefore, a point that is the very essence of strategy is knowing how to choose
 what to do and what not to do. The development of competitive strategy has
 a broad nature involving how the company will compete, what its goals should
 be, and what policies are necessary to achieving these goals.
<br> This spectrum of choices contains two groups of factors that influence deci
sions: the external competitive environment in which the company is active and
 its own internal characteristics. In turn, each of these unfolds into two other
 factors.
<br> Both the threats to companies and their opportunities are to be found in the
 competitive environment. Internally, the company has both strengths and
 weaknesses. The SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats)
 analysis has the objective of recognizing limitations, maximizing the organiza
tions’ strong points while monitoring opportunities and threats in the competi
tive environment. Models, such the Structure Analysis of Industry (Porter,
 1979), help to understand the external environment. There are models such as
 Core Competencies (Prahalad & Hamel, 1990) which lend themselves to
 analyzing the internal situation of companies. Both types of models will be
 studied in later chapters of this book</p>
        <center><h1><b> The Alignment of Forces to Build a
 Good Strategy. Can a Good
 Strategy Be Replicated or is There a
 Formula for a Good Strategy?</b></h1></center>
        <hr>
        <p> According to Porter, the choice of an adequate positioning aims at determining
 which activities the company should carry out and also which it should not. As
 a consequence, the company should conceive of an internal configuration
 appropriate for executing these activities and also how the activities will be
 related amongst themselves. This interrelationship among activities should seek
 not just compatibilization, but reciprocal reinforcement as well, thus increasing
 the potential to obtain the competitive advantage desired by the company.
<br> According to this reasoning, Porter considers the existence of three levels of
 compatibilization, which could sometimes occur simultaneously: consistency of  activities with the company’s strategy, mutual reinforcement among the activi
ties, and optimization of effort.
<br> Consistency between company strategy and each activity in the functional
 realm is the first level of compatibilization, which prompts accumulation (and
 not contradiction) of the competitive advantage of these activities. This creates
 a single vision of strategy, which improves its implementation as well as
 facilitating its communication and its transmission to clients, employees, and
 shareholders. The American airline company, Southwest (the model for the
 Brazilian GOL), for example, suspended on-board meals and promoted more
 frequent rotation of planes within its strategy for low cost, marketing to a price
sensitive public looking for convenience.
<br> At the next level, not just consistency is sought, but rather that there be a mutual
 reinforcement among activities so that they produce mutually reinforcing
 effects. Software companies put test versions (the so-called beta versions) of
 their product at the disposal of some users. Testing these versions through use
 permits errors to be corrected, features to be changed, and also reinforces the
 intent of the users to use the software.
<br> When compatiblization reaches the third level, there is an optimization of effort.
 The most basic form of this optimization involves the flow of information and
 coordination, with a view to eliminating redundancies and minimizing losses.
<br> There are more elaborate forms, such as those used in the development of
 product designs that transfer installation and support activities to the user or the
 establishment of partnerships with suppliers and distribution channels. For
 instance, limited menus in fast-food chains allow them to maintain quick service
 with a standardized operational efficiency consistent with their purposes.
 <br>Note that these compatibility factors indicate that the set of activities, and not
 each activity, is what is important to establishing and maintaining competitive
 advantage. Concern with the search for excellence in performance of individual
 activities is a feature of operational efficiency; it is not a strategy. For Porter
 (1996), it is the totality of the system of activities that emanates competitive
 advantage and consequently, the success of strategy. Efficiency in individual
 activities, as we have seen, can be more easily copied than this integration of
 activities within the company.
<br> Meanwhile, market pressures generate an environment that some call “hyper
competition” and in this circumstance, companies often limit themselves to
 imitating their rivals, and this alone reinforces competition since it levels the
 antagonists. Acting in this way, the companies cease to have a strategy, since
 they stop making the necessary choices</p>
        <p>This scenario favors seeking operational efficiency since it can generate
 palpable results in little time and the companies are focused on performance
 measures. It appears to be a more certain route than assuming the risks of
 making decisions about strategy, which means letting go of some things in favor
 of others. These choices also can force the company to abdicate some clients
 and some income, which from the immediate perspective, is not attractive. .
<br> This does not mean that operational efficiency is not desirable; increasing it is
 a necessary part of managing a company, however, it is not a strategy. Both
 operational efficiency and strategy are very important, but different due to their
 different focuses.
<br> Operational efficiency is focused on continuous improvements to all aspects
 and not making mutually exclusive choices, which is intrinsically different than
 making trade offs. In this context, there is a search for constant changes,
 flexibility, and a continuous effort to achieve the best practices. On the other
 hand, the focus of strategy aims at defining a unique position, making very clear
 trade-offs and making activities compatible. To accomplish this, ways of
 reinforcing the company’s position are continuously sought and this requires
 discipline and continuity.
<br> Therefore, strategic continuity does not mean having a static view of the
 competitive scenario. The company will need to change its strategy if there are
 significant changes in the structure of the industry. Meanwhile, the choice of a
 new position should be guided by the ability to make new trade-offs and to
 develop a new system of complementary activities, (which makes the search for
 continued improvements more efficacious) to obtain a sustainable advantage.
 <br>Campbell and Alexander similarly stress that companies and managers develop
 “fads” such as TQM (total quality management), benchmarking, and
 reengineering, and others, seeking to stay out in front of their competitors. In
 turn, these adopt the same fads, (in addition to generating others), under the risk
 of not obtaining the competitive advantage if their rivals do so and are
 successful. It can be seen then that fads produce better results, but do not
 resolve issues in the long-term since they do not usually lead to developing
 strategy.
<br> Markides (1999) complements the above perspectives, warning that unique
 strategic positions are transitory. More aggressive competitors will seek to
 imitate these positions if they prove to be attractive, and in fact, no strategic
 position is truly unique. In addition, given the dynamics of business activities,
 new strategic positions arise continuously.</p>
        <p> New positions occur based on new combinations of responses to three basic
 questions: who, what, and how to challenge the dominance of the reigning
 positions. Thus, in reaching a new segment of consumers, by creating a new
 value proposal or even a new means of producing or distributing a product, the
 business will be creating a new strategic position.
 <br>This process can occur in any industry, if the same apparently inexpugnable
 strategies can be overthrown by unknown companies that base themselves in
 the creation and exploration of new strategic positions in an industry.
<br> Markides shows that this process begins with the “dominant” enterprises in
 industry creating unique strategic positions. “Traditional” companies (perhaps
 “traditionalist” is better said) imitate these dominant companies, seeking to
 obtain part of the market. On the other hand, there are more and more “strategic
 innovators”, who conquer large parcels of the market, frequently of the new
 markets that they help to create. Among examples of this last type of company,
 the author included, among others, Canon (commented upon in the box above)
 and Dell (commented upon further along in this chapter).
<br> Note that Hamel (1996) made an analogous classification, dividing companies
 into three types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Rule makers: </b>these are the leaders who build an industry, the dominant
 oligarch. They include large companies such as IBM, United Airlines,
 Coca Cola, and Hertz, the car rental agency.</li>
            <li><b> Rule tailers:</b>these render tribute to the industry leaders, which for Hamel
 is very little to serve as a strategy. For examples we can site Fujitsu,
 McDonnell Douglas, and Avis, the car rental agency.</li>
            <li><b>Rule breakers:</b>companies that rewrite the rules, inverting the order of
 things in the industries where they are active, these are the discontent,
 radical, and revolutionary of the industry. Dell computer would fall into
 this category as well as the watch maker Swatch and Southwest Airlines.</li>
             </ul>
        <p> Returning to Markides view, it is not possible to predict what the emerging strategic
 positions will be. Therefore, in facing market uncertainties, companies have two
 generic options: innovate or exploit the innovations of another company. Note that
 both options can be adopted by either established enterprises or by new entrants.
 Thus strategy is essentially dynamic and, in this context, a business should be
 guided by the following points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Establish a distinctive strategic position in the industry where it is active.</li>
            <li> Compete on the basis of this position in order to be better than the industry
 competition.</li>
            <li>Constantly be on the lookout for new strategic positions.</li>
            <li> When identifying another viable strategic position in the industry, the
 company should attempt the difficult task of administering both positions
 simultaneously. To the extent that the old position matures and begins to
 decline, the company should gradually make a transition to the new
 position. The cycle then should be recommenced: when competing in the
 new position, the search for yet another new viable strategic position
 should continue.</li>
            </ul>
        <p> In this process, the company should eventually make a leap to a new technology
 or even into another industry. However, in moving to a new industry the
 company should repeat the process of dynamic strategy.
<br> Thus, for Markides, strategy means that the companies, even those that are
 presently successful, should continuously revise and challenge their responses
 to the questions: who, what, and how, in order to remain flexible and ready to
 adjust their strategies in the eventuality that market responses not be favorable.</p>
        <center><h1><b>Characteristics and Elements of
 Competitive Strategy</b></h1></center>
        <hr>
        <p> To finalize this chapter which discusses the concept of strategy, it is worth
 making some final comments about the nature and characteristics of competi
tive strategy.
<br> In addition, there is a question about who should be concerned with the
 company’s strategy. For several authors, developing strategy is the main
 objective of the executives of a business.
<br> Hamel (1996) however, has a different opinion, stating that strategy should be
 a matter disseminated at various levels of the hierarchy, based on his point of
 view that strategy should be of a revolutionary nature.
 <br> In Hamel’s view, upper-level executives are impregnated with industry dogma,
 have more homogenous experiences, and a strong connection to what was  done in the past. Thus, it is unlikely that they will become the promoters of the
 revolution that he preaches must occur for companies to remain competitive.
 <br>The revolutionaries, however can be found in all companies and at different
 levels of the hierarchy, and should be engaged in a discussion of the future, thus
 becoming “strategy activists”. The company should change perspective, in
volving the highest levels of the hierarchy (where the monopoly on allocating
 resources lies) as well as the mid and lower levels (where there is more
 imagination and propensity to change). The process of developing strategy in
 itself should be seen as a strategy involving all levels of the company in such a
 way as to make possible the changes needed for the survival and success of the
 company.</p>
        <p> Henderson (1989), some basic elements are present in a competitive strategy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> The ability to understand the competitive environment as an interactive
 system (competitors, customers, money, people, resources).</li>
            <li> Ability in using this understanding to predict the effects of a strategic move.</li>
            <li> Resources can be committed to new uses even when the benefits are not
 immediate.</li>
            <li> Ability in foreseeing the risks and returns with sufficient accuracy to justify
 the new use of resources.</li>
            <li>Disposition for action</li>
             </ul>
        <p> As has been observed, strategy is revolutionary (here used in a less “subver
sive” sense than in Hamel’s view), since it is deliberate, and aimed at rapid
 changes in competitive relations. According to Henderson (1989), there are
 factors inhibiting this revolutionary nature — the failure and advantages inherent
 in the position of an attentive defender.
<br> Over time, one can observe alternating periods of more or less heightened
 competition. Further, beginning at the end of the 20th century, the periods of
 calm have become shorter.
 <br>Strategy depends on subjective judgments of one’s own actions and those of one’s
 rivals. A posteriori analysis of events reveals that it is not always the strategy which
 appears evident that had been previously imagined.
 For Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and Lampel (1998), strategy has the following
 aspects, present in the different schools they studied:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Having to do with the organization as well as the environment:</b>
 There is a need for an organization to know itself as well as the
 environment in which it operates.</li>
            <li><b> Its essence is complex: </b>The process of defining and implementing
 strategy involves several, often conflicting variables.</li>
            <li><b> Involves issues of content as well as process:</b> A well-thought-out and
 planned strategy needs adequate implementation. Likewise, one can think
 of the need for an adequate process to conceive strategy.</li>
            <li><b>  It is not purely deliberative:</b>Strategy can be deliberated (planned, the
 result of will), but it frequently is a result of events and opportunities that
 appear in the course of a company’s activities; in these circumstances, the
 strategy is called emergent.</li>
            <li><b>Exists at several levels:</b>There is corporate strategy, which determines
 in which business to be active, and also business strategy, which seeks the
 best means of competing in a given business area.</li>
            <li><b> Involves several thought processes:</b> Strategy involves work in con
ceptualizing as well as analyzing the situation. Therefore, the elements
 present in strategy are there so that one can understand the process of
 developing business strategy. In the chapters which follow, these factors
                will be discussed in detail.</li>
        </ul>

 Decisions in Perspective</b></h1></center>
        <hr>
        <h1><b>Case – A Modern Conflict: Apple vs. IBM, The First
 Personal Computer War</b></h1>
        <hr>
        <p> The 1970s — at that time, the computer market was heavily dominated by IBM
 and its enormous mainframes, also maintaining the greatest market share, and
 the largest profits as well.
<br> A new company launched a product that initially had more of an entertainment
 than a work function. The company was Apple and the product, the microcom  puter. Based on the ideas that its buyers liked to work with electronics, it had
 modular components and several slots that permitted a number of improve
ments and expansions. Meanwhile, new software for the microcomputer
 (called Apple II+) introduced the industry to a new course: the electronic
 spreadsheet. The appearance of the first electronic spreadsheet (Visicalc)
 showed the enormous potential the microcomputers had for business. Apple
 II+ sales grew at an amazing rate and other microcomputer manufacturers leapt
 in to dispute the new market.
<br> At first IBM did not react. But the growth of microcomputer sales began to
 discomfit the mainframe market. IBM’s first attempt at reacting was to deny
 that the microcomputer had the potential to replace the mainframe. Later, it
 realized its error and launched the concept of end-user product, which was
 software for mainframes. This was more user-friendly, which was one of the
 main arguments in favor of microcomputers. The results were not what IBM
 had wanted. A new strategy was needed. In an attempt to gain time, IBM
 sought partners to launch its first microcomputer, in an intense outsourcing
 process. Its main partners became Intel for the micro processing chip and
 Microsoft for the software. The IBM PC introduced in 1981 (followed by the
 PC XT in 1983 and PC AT in 1984) was a big success and became the market
 standard whose descendents are on the market today.
<br> Later, the PC industry moved on to new victories. For the time being, IBM
 remained in an advantageous position.
 <br>Returning to the story at the beginning of this chapter, one can imagine an
 analogy with military strategy. Apple attacked IBM’s territory with a very
 innovative strategy. IBM initially insisted on fighting on its own ground, tried
 guerrilla warfare, and finally attacked Apple on its own territory and managed
 a victory.
<br> The use of the analogy, especially to military strategy, is very common in the
 studying of business strategy. Nevertheless, certain caution should be exer
cised since this is a resource to facilitate understanding and should not be taken
 literally. As was said regarding von Clausewitz, analogies should be used as a
 source of inspiration.</p>
        <h1><b> Case – Sources of Strategic Positioning: Lojas Yamada</b></h1>
        <hr>
        <p> The Grupo Yamada, a chain of stores in the state of Pará, founded by the
 Japanese immigrant Yoshio Yamada 50 years ago, made a “preferential option for the poor” and became the largest retail chain in its state. Exploiting the
 peculiarities of local customs and creating stores for the low-income customer
 in the informal economy (popcorn vendors, open air market vendors, manicur
ists, domestic employees, and ambulatory vendors), it experienced an extraor
dinary rate of growth in its sales from 63 millionreais to 379 million in 1999.
 To attain this result, it facilitated credit for people without a stable or registered
 employment, opened up space for those in the informal economy (which
 absorbs 40% of the economically active population), and 70% of its clientele
 are low-income customers. The principal credit mechanism is the company’s
 own credit card which is responsible for almost 80% of the chain’s income.
 <br>Even though these customers had shown themselves to be better payers than
 was supposed, as a preventive measure, the company created a credit and
 payment management system unique in the country, that utilizes specialized
 informants as well as a computerized system of credit analysis. With this, they
 can evaluate a client’s credit application in 15 minutes. However, it overlooks
 overdue payments when this will lead to customer loyalty and offers life
 insurance (to ensure payments), permanent disability, and loss of income.
 <br>In addition, Yamada knows how to deal with local logistical difficulties and
 knows its customers’ peculiarities, which include the typical local cuisine.
 <br>In this way, the company sought a strategic position based in the creation of a
 differentiated form of access to consumption for low-income clients.

        <h1><b> Case – Copying Strategies for Copying?</b></h1>
        <hr>
        <p> According to Markides, an illustrative example of seeking a unique strategic
 position can be found in the photocopying industry. Xerox was the leader in this
 market in the 1960s with a singular and defined strategy which prioritized
 corporate clients and focused on the production of large copiers which were
 rented, not sold, by its own sales force. In the 1970s, weighty rivals such as
 IBM and Kodak adopted the same or similar strategies but did not manage to
 achieve similar success. Both sought the same large corporate market and IBM
 even adopted the practice of rental.
<br> Canon, in turn, came to be the leader (in terms of volume) in the 1980s, serving
 small and medium companies as well as the end user with smaller copying
 machines with attractive pricing and quality. The machines were sold — not rented — and their commercialization was done through a network of interme
diaries.</p>
        <h1><b> Case – The Second PC War: Dell Computer
 Corporation vs. IBM and COMPAQ</b></h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Among the many companies that began to manufacture microcomputers on the
 PC standard, one presented a new form of working that had a big impact on
 its results. This is the Dell Computer Corporation.
 Founded in 1984, it began by making upgrades of IBM PC clones. Beginning
 in 1985, it started to produce its own computers.
<br> Dell analyzed the direct competition and perceived that IBM, Compaq, and
 Hewlett Packard (HP) sold through intermediaries. As a consequence, there
 was an increase in stock and costs and the response time for final consumers
 was slow. Michael Dell, founder, president, and CEO of Dell Computer,
 resolved then to sell directly to end-consumers. This means an intense effort to
 reconceptualize stock management, logistics, and all the administration of the
 supply chain. Further, Dell concentrated on selling to companies to whom it
 could sell machines of higher value.
 <br>In fine tune with the supply chain, it was possible to reduce both time and cost
 of production and distribution.
<br> Even though the basic ideas of this strategy were present from the beginning,
 the grand catalyst was the advent and dissemination of the Internet, which
 greatly facilitated its implementation. Before this, Dell had undergone difficul
ties due to the obsolescence of a lot of existing microprocessors in large
 quantity in its stock, as well as having tried unsuccessfully to commercialize its
 PC’s through retail outlets.
 <br>In Dell’s formula, not only are sales direct to clients, but production is only
 initiated when an order is placed. Further, the company focuses on service
 delivery and technical assistance, by telephone and house calls. Products,
 targeted on companies as a priority, include the most recent technological
 advances and therefore, have a higher added value.
<br> Consistently acting in this way, Dell billed more than 30 billion dollars in 2001,
 becoming the largest company in the PC sector, still in an intense dispute with
 HP.</p>
        <p> Therefore, in terms of Markides ideas about dynamic strategy, Dell innovated
 significantly in the “how” to develop its activities and was a revolutionary
 company.
 Adapted from news on thePortal Exame and from Reid & Sanders (2002).</p>
        <h1><b> Case – Remedies for Strategy and Strategy for Remedies</b></h1>
        <hr>
        <p> The Distribuidora de Medicamentos Panarello, of the state of Goiânia, was
 founded by Paulo Panarello of São Paulo and is the largest Brazilian company
 in the remedy distribution sector of approximately 300 companies. Its trajec
tory is of interest to the study of strategy.
 The company billed 870 million dollars in 2000 (15.7% of retail medicine sales
 in the national market) which represents significant growth in relation to the 200
 million of six years earlier.
 <br>The founder had to help with family finance from the age of eight, selling
 popsicles made by his mother in open-air markets. Later he had his own
 businesses, starting with a car mechanic shop, then a fleet of taxis, a restaurant,
 and a construction firm for low-income clients. At the time he was not yet 25
 years old.
<br> A stroke of luck helped to shape his future when a sister-in-law married
 Emiliano Sanches, the owner of SEM laboratories, a major producer of generic
 drugs. He then represented EMS in Goiania. In this city, Panarello opened a
 drug distributor that started small. However, right away he obtained conces
sions from other laboratories, expanding his business at first to the rest of the
 state of Goiás and later to the states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, finally
 achieving coverage of 21 states in the northeast, central-western, southeast,
 and southern regions of the country by the mid-1990s. The northern region,
 except Tocantins, was left out of his plans due to difficulties and the cost of
 access.
<br> Thus, the company became the drug distributor with the largest geographic
 coverage, obtaining a big competitive advantage since there are more than
 50,000 pharmacies dispersed throughout Brazil, which makes direct distribu
tion nonviable.
 <br>Panarello’s team of 900 sales representatives uses telemarketing and electronic
 commerce. One of the company’s strengths is services provided to laboratories
 (such as when new drugs are launched) and also partnerships with pharmacies  (for whom Panarello provides financing and more generous payment terms than
 the average practice in the sector).
 In the 1980s, two circumstances helped drive the growth of the company. First,
 there were large gains made from the financial markets during the high inflation
 period prior to the Plano Real economic program, thanks to long-term payment
 plans with it suppliers. The second factor was obtaining generous financial
 benefits conceded by the government of Goias. Thus, Panarello was able to
 begin the new decade with more resources on-hand than the competitors.
 In this context, in the mid-1990s, approximately half of the cmpanies in the
 sector failed, including many of his largest rivals, who did not adapt themselves
 to the end of the inflationary times. Further, many distributors also had their own
 pharmacies which caused problems with lack of focus. Panarello then concen
trated on serving isolated pharmacies, taking advantage of the spaces not
 served by competitors.
 <br>The company was also concerned with its operational efficiency. It invested
 more than one million dollars installing computerized conveyors in its Porto
 Alegre and São Paulo affiliates, which automatically separate orders (accepted
 up to 100reais—approximately 40 dollars), thus making service quicker. All
 the lots are registered in a computerized system that identifies individual sales.
 <br>IT acquired a system for integrated management (the R3 by SAP) that in
 addition to controlling all activities, also serves as a marketing tool against
